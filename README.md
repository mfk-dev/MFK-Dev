- I only know HTML, CSS, a little bit of Javascript and Python right now but im developing myself, and i believe i'll be good at this coding thing.
- My main goal is to be a computer engineer and work in a company that is related with Astronomy. For example: "TUA" ( Turkiye Space Agency )
- My side goals are:
  - Being a full-stack developer.
  - Being a cyber security expert.
  - Also, maybe becoming a AI Engineer.
- Yes, maybe these goals are hard when you collect them together, but whatever, why do i even exist if im not going to try things?

### Things I like:

- Sci-fi.
- Games.
